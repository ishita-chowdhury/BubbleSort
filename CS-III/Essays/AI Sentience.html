  <p><b> Artificial Intelligence: The Future and What it Holds</b></p>


  <p>
Artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging technology consisting of computer systems that are able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence (Future of Life Institute, 2021). From SIRI to self-driving cars, artificial intelligence is practically everywhere and is used in our everyday lives.  Known as weak AI, it’s predominately used for simple tasks such as recognizing face ID (Future of Life Institute, 2021). However, the long-term goal of many researchers is to create general AI, where it is designed to outperform humans at almost all cognitive tasks (Future of Life Institute, 2021). The AI that is incorporated into our daily lives is deemed beneficial, especially since it performs tasks that are helpful to us, but it may pose problems in the near future. 
  </p>

  <p>Let us start with the many advantages of artificial intelligence first. One of the most important benefits artificial intelligence offers is its reduction to human error (Sunil Kumar, 2019). Humans are prone to cause mistakes and in turn affect the credibility and reliability of the program. With Artificial intelligence, the decisions taken are from the previously gathered information after applying a certain set of algorithms (Sunil Kumar, 2019). In turn, errors are reduced and reaching accuracy with a greater degree of precision is achievable (Sunil Kumar, 2019). For example, using artificial intelligence in weather forecasting has been proven beneficial and has reduced the majority of human errors. Another advantage of artificial intelligence is it being more susceptible to risks than humans (Sunil Kumar, 2019). Using AI or AI powered robots to take on the risky tasks can allow humans to be safe when collecting data or doing a job (Sunil Kumar, 2019). Examples include defusing a bomb, exploring the low altitude parts of oceans, mining for coal or oil, or inspecting any natural or man-made disasters (Sunil Kumar, 2019). AI can also be used for extended periods of time when necessary, unlike humans who have a working capacity (Sunil Kumar, 2019). AI machines can work 24/7 to get a job done faster and relieve the work and stress load on humans who need to work night shifts. Through AI, digital assistance was introduced to the digital age as well (Sunil Kumar, 2019). The digital assistance is seen in company websites to interact with customers which saves the need for human resources (Sunil Kumar, 2019). They are usually seen in chatbot form, and are used to clarify any doubts or questions of the customers. The conversation interactions are usually very lifelike, and seem like you are talking to an actual person (Sunil Kumar, 2019). Just like a chatbot or SIRI, AI is also powering many inventions in other domains which will help humans solve the majority of complex problems. In a recent study, it is shown that doctors can predict breast cancer in the woman at her earlier stages using advanced AI technologies (Sunil Kumar, 2019).

    However, artificial intelligence also comes with some doubts and risks. Artificial intelligence lacks transparency. Some machine learning algorithms are unexplainable or kept in secret, as the producer of the AI pleases (Chiara Arena, 2022). This leads to limited understanding of the bias or faults AI can carry. U.S. courts have started implementing AI to determine a defendant's risk to commit another crime, which would then influence their sentences, parole, or bail time (Chiara Arena, 2022). The problem is such that there is little knowledge or transparency regarding how these tools determine the results. Without proper safeguards put in place or any federal laws that regulate the basis in which the tool is evaluating the defendant, these tools risk putting individual rights in jeopardy (Chiara Arena, 2022). In the case of defendant Eric Loomis, the judge gave Loomis a long sentence because of the "high risk" score he received after answering a series of questions that were then evaluated by Compas, an AI tool that assesses the risk factor (Chiara Arena, 2022). No one knows how exactly Compas arrived at the conclusion and on what basis the conclusion was made to determine that Loomis is ‘high risk’ to society (Chiara Arena, 2022). For all we know, Compas may base its decisions on factors that are discriminatory, such as relying on data than can be racist, ageist, or sexist (Chiara Arena, 2022). AI is also at risk in building specific profiles of people. AI also carries the risk of spreading disinformation. In 2020, the Activist Group Extinction Rebellion used AI to create a deepfake of the Belgian prime minister Sophie Wilmès to manipulate her words in a fictional speech about Covid-19. Unfortunately, this is among many cases (Chiara Arena, 2022). This process “threatens democratic processes and causes societal polarization” (Chiara Arena, 2022). Online bots add to the slew of misinformation, by creating fake news articles altered to push fabricated perspectives or tweets. Not only can AI affect the digital world, but also the physical world. AI is linked to causing significant environmental damage due to its intensive energy usage (Chiara Arena, 2022). According to a 2019 study, a particular type of AI (deep learning in natural language processing) has a huge carbon footprint due to the fuel the hardware requires (Chiara Arena, 2022). Experts say that training a single AI model produces 300,000 kg of CO2 emissions, which is roughly equivalent to 125 round trip flights from NYC to Beijing (Chiara Arena, 2022). This just adds to the impending climate crisis. </p>

  <p> 
    Lastly, one disadvantage that a large chunk of the world’s population can suffer from due to AI is unemployment. The consensus among many experts is that “a number of professions will be totally automated in the next five to ten years” (Chiara Arena, 2022). Some senior-level tech executives from the Forbes Technology Council named a few including warehouse and manufacturing jobs, customer service, research and data entry, long haul trucking and a broad category titled “Any Tasks That Can Be Learned” (Chiara Arena, 2022). The incorporation or replacement of AI is most likely to be in low-skilled jobs, such as administrative tasks, construction, or logistical services due to its mass productivity and efficacy in those areas (Mike Thomas, 2021). Hence, it would contribute to the overwhelming loss in lower waged jobs or available jobs for the less-educated (Mike Thomas, 2021). This could lead to a growth in income polarization and mass unemployment (Mike Thomas, 2021). This in turn can lead to economic insecurity, which can be a huge threat to our democracies, with people losing trust in political institutions (Mike Thomas, 2021).

  <p>
    Overall, it is hard to determine if the pros outweigh the cons or vice versa, but it can be safely concluded that artificial intelligence has made an impact in our world already and is most likely here to stay. Now what it holds for us in the future, is definitely something the world will be watching closely. </p>
